<p>There are many different ways to gather Student voice, and none of them is without risks and faults.

<h3>  Advantages of Anonymous vs named feedback</h3> 
There is much discussion about the advantages of anonymous vs named feedback i have linked it below. There needs to be a sufficient level of trust between learners and educators, so learners feel that their thoughts and opinions will be respected and not held against them. 
<br><br>
 It is also important to note that when student details are collected with student voice there needs to be a way for students to receive updates and conclusions allow students to feel their voices are being listened to and heard. All instances of student's voice should be responded to even if it is to explain why it cannot happen. If students feel their voices are ignored, they may choose not to share it again.
<br><br>
<h4> Survey design</h4> 
<br><br>
 It is essential to keep surveying students to a minimum. Surveying maybe an easy way to collect massive amounts of data but some students switch off very quickly when they realise surveys are long-winded.

<br></br>
<i>"Keep them short keep them to the point.'</i> 
<br><br>
Use simple to understand language and allow the learners ample time to record their thoughts. Questions should be not targeted towards any particular issue. 
<br><br>
Recording information about student discussions
Students may be more open to having a group discussion about their thoughts and opinions in an open-air environment. It is essential to take notes to ensure the accuracy of the information a natural way that is easy to do is to write their thoughts an opinion on the board as we discuss them this shows the students I am not manipulating their opinions and thoughts.

							<p>Collecting student voice is only half the battle. The learners need to feel their thoughts and opinion are valued and that they are taken seriously. Ways to use Student's voice.

<h4>Staff Reporting</h4> 
Teaching staff whom assist student voice groups can create proposals, memos and documents on behalf of the Students. This is a great thing to consider if the workload on students is exceptionally high it can also remove any undue pressure and stress.
</br></br>
<h4>Student Reporting</h4> 
Allow students to create their own proposals, memos and documents this has the advantage of being more honest but can be more pressure and stress on students.
</br></br>
<h4>Transformative information</h4> 
This pertains to information which the student wishes an action to take place or an issue to be resolved. This information will need to be dealt with on a case by case basis to ensure correct school processes are followed. It will help to have a Staff member or SLT in charge of looking after the Student's voice to help manage these decisions.</p>
